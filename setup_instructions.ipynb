    "## Definitions\n",
    "* **Dash** allows entire website to be written in Python by wrapping web components and facilitating 2-way communication (callbacks)\n",
    "* **Plotly.js** Allows access to powerful ecosystem of data visalisations (40 chart types) that run responsively client side. Dash is built on top of this library. The library itself is built on top of d3.js and stack.gl.\n",
    "* **React.js** \tAn open-source, front end, JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. Notably Dash is written on top of this.\n",
    "* **WSGI (HTTP) Server** \tHTTP server that manages incoming requests from the browser.\n",
    "* **Gunicorn** A Python library designed to work with WSGI (HTTP) Server\n",
    "* **Heroku** A scalable platform-as-a-service (PaaS) to deploy and physically host your web application and make it accessible on the internet.\n",
